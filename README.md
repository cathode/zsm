zsm: ZFS Snapshot Manager
===

zsm is a small application that provides extremely flexible scheduling of ZFS snapshots. It does not rely on the names of snapshots to determine which snaps to remove.

It requires a recent version of Mono to be installed, and runs as a daemon (run in a screen session for best results).
